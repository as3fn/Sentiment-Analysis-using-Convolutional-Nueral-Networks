# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Convolutional-Nueral-Networks
## udacity ML capstone project

This is the final project in the udacity machine learning engineer nanodegree. The project compares a cnn modle against a benchmark modle (logistic regression). The modle was developed using Google's colab platform.


### Datasets 
**IMDB:**
A large movie reviews dataset of positive and negative reviews used for training and testing and can be downloaded from:
http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/


**Joker (2019)**
A small dataset of the joker's movie to validate the model, the joker.txt was the file used for testing, the jokr.html is the reviews raw text plus the reviews links.


### Code
The dataprocessing step and the benchmark development can be found in `Bench.ipynb` file. The CNN model can be found in the `modle.ipynb` file.
